Here, I am documenting the methods for building AI applications using the langchain framework, 
mainly including:
calling large models, setting up RAG applications, building intelligent agents, scraping Bilibili video subtitles and saving them to a vector database, reading the database, integrating the database, deploying the langchain program. 
Welcome everyone to learn and provide guidance together.
